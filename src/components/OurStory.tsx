        Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the
        image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and brake them to pieces.
        Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken
        to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer
        threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found
        for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain,
        and filled the whole earth.
