This is a website I made for a growing church in Nigeria. It is a simple 4-page website, that displays information about the church. I made this website in 4 days as a remote freelancing gig. It was meant to just be a simple website with rectangular images and a plain font, but I took it a step further and customized the images I was given into different shapes and sizes on Canva, I also picked out a livelier font on Google Fonts for the website. The clients appreciated the website, but it is still yet to be released to the public for use.

Using TailwindCSS breakpoints, I was able to make it fully responsive for mobile, tablet, laptop, and larger screens.

While building this website, I was able to improve my skills on some React principles and concepts, such as:

*   Using React Memo
*   Passing and receiving props
*   Using custom fonts in React, etc.

**Key NPM Packages used:**  react-router-dom
